            <h4>ABOUT THE BOOK</h4>
            <p>
              A patriarch of the Faith was passing through a certain village
              some years ago, asking if anyone was dead, and he searched the
              entire town for anyone dead to be brought back to life.
              Fortunately, he met a family whose child had just died, and the
              child who had died had come back to life. If something is declared
              dead, it can no longer live in its natural habitat. It makes no
              difference how dead you are; Lazarus was dead for four days, even
              decaying, but when Jesus Christ arrived, he called him forth from
              the grave. If you're reading this and you're dead in your spirit,
              body, and mind, all you need is Jesus Christ to wake you up.
