            <h4>ABOUT THE BOOK</h4>
            <p>
              A patriarch of the Faith was passing through a certain village
              some years ago, asking if anyone was dead, and he searched the
              entire town for anyone dead to be brought back to life.
              Fortunately, he met a family whose child had just died, and the
              child who had died had come back to life. If something is declared
              dead, it can no longer live in its natural habitat. It makes no
              difference how dead you are; Lazarus was dead for four days, even
              decaying, but when Jesus Christ arrived, he called him forth from
              the grave. If you're reading this and you're dead in your spirit,
              body, and mind, all you need is Jesus Christ to wake you up.

          <h4>ABOUT THE BOOK</h4>
          <p>
            The subject of Revival is beyond the knowledge of men and it cannot be
            birth by the normal exercise of men. One of the strategies God uses to
            cause revival is to cause men to be uncomfortable with the aroma that
            oozes from the armpit of this world. In this book, Brother Kayode Faramola
            revealed the codes of revival and more importantly, shows that the coming
            Revival will definitely be anchor by the bride of Christ- The Church.

            Revival is not a program and not a church service. It is an upsurge in every
            sector that the heart of men will flee after righteousness. This book you are
            holding in your hands unveil that; No revival breaks out without men turning
            away from the path that seemeth right but the end thereof is death. Revival
            begins within a man before it break forth in his environment thereby causing
            his world to sit at the feet of Jesus as we learn the culture of Zion. And it shall
            come to pass on that day that a man shall look to his Maker and his eyes shall
            have respect to the Holy One of Isreal. Isaiah 17vs7.
